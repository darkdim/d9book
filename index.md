## Drupal at your fingertips
### Drupal 9 & 10 developer's quick code reference
by Selwyn Polit
{: .text-delta}

This book is a quick reference for developers creating Drupal sites. While working on such sites during my career, I have gathered a large collection of notes and code which I use for my reference.  I hope it will be useful for you, too.

During my hunting through examples on [Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/drupal) and many other places, I often wished there was a succinct set of current annotated code samples explaining how to do things the [Drupal way](https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/sessions/drupal-way-philosophy).  Of course, there is the excellent [examples module](https://www.drupal.org/project/examples), which is very handy. But this book is designed to otherwise fill that gap. Please forgive the `todo` items, but I've found that if I want to get it perfect, it won't ever get published. 

You are invited to contribute (in the open source way) by making edits and pull requests at [this link on Github](https://github.com/selwynpolit/d9book/tree/gh-pages/book).  There is a very simple online editor which automatically forks the repo and lets you type your changes directly in your browser in [markdown format](https://github.github.com/gfm/). Try it by editing a chapter of interest to you. And while you are here, [see who else contributed to the masterpiece ðŸ˜‰](attribution)

If you are inspired, please be a part of this project by contributing your own thoughts, code snippets, tutorials, links etc. (Imposters are welcomed!) Add your name on the [attribution page](attribution). Either add a note in the comment form at the bottom of each page or click the `Edit this page on GitHub` also at the very bottom of any page and start editing.  You don't need to know Git.
